## What is a Sales Funnel?

A sales funnel is like a roadmap that guides potential customers from the moment they discover your product to the point where they make a purchase. It’s made up of several stages, each playing a crucial role in converting leads into paying customers. Let’s break it down:

1. **Awareness:** This is where you introduce your app to the world. It’s all about getting people to know about your product and why they should care.
2. **Interest:** Once people are aware of your app, they’ll start exploring its features and benefits. This is your chance to show them why your app is the best choice for them.
3. **Consideration:** Now, it’s time for potential customers to weigh their options and decide if your app is the right fit for them. This is where you can provide them with the information they need to make an informed decision.
4. **Conversion:** The final stage is where you turn leads into paying customers. It’s all about making sure they understand the value of your app and are ready to take the plunge.
5. **Retention:** Once customers have made a purchase, it’s important to keep them engaged and coming back for more. This is where you can provide excellent customer service and build a loyal customer base.
